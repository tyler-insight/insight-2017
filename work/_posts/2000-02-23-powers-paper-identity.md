<a href="http://powerspaper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Powers Paper, LLC</a> is brand new company revolutionizing the away-from-home towel and tissue market. A small company, competing against gargantuan multi-national corporations, Powers Paper products offer superior performance and cost savings, plus their “hook”—an innovative business model that is designed to provide distributors with a sustainable competitive advantage. Their business proposition is further complicated by the need to reach both the foodservice and janitorial-sanitation markets and within each to speak to three separate audiences:

- **End users**—those actually using the napkins, toweling and other Powers Paper products.
- **End buyers**—restaurants, offices, etc. that purchase the products to use in their locations.
- **Distributors**—the “middle men” who buy wholesale, transport and warehouse the products and sell them to the end buyers.

## Goal

Creating this company was an ambitious endeavor and developing their marketing communications no small task!

Powers Paper came to Insight with a challenge: To help them launch this company and make the industry aware of their presence in a big way! This meant developing **brand messaging, logos, packaging, photography, tradeshow graphics, ads, collateral materials, dispenser graphics and a website**(!) that would work for ALL of Powers Paper’s audiences—in an extremely tight eight-week timeframe—before the company was set to make its debut at a major Las Vegas show. Whew!
